# Vortex-Persian-NLP

**Vortex-Persian-NLP** is an advanced natural language processing (NLP) model tailored for the Persian language, built with cutting-edge deep learning architectures. This project utilizes the power of transformer-based models and LSTM layers, along with attention mechanisms to perform a wide variety of NLP tasks, including but not limited to, text classification, named entity recognition, machine translation, and text generation.

The core of the system revolves around a robust feedback loop for continual self-improvement, enabling the model to adapt based on evaluation metrics like BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR. This system is designed to continuously learn from new data, optimize performance, and provide more accurate responses over time.

## Key Features
- **Deep Learning Models**: Utilizes the latest transformer models (LLaMA, T5) integrated with attention mechanisms and LSTM layers.
- **Self-improvement**: Automatic fine-tuning based on BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR evaluation metrics to ensure the model is continuously improving.
- **Persian Language Support**: Optimized for Persian NLP tasks with datasets like Persian SQuAD, Persian Q&A, and WikiPersian.
- **Data Augmentation**: Includes multiple augmentation techniques such as synonym replacement, backtranslation, and text summarization for diverse training data.
- **Optimized for Performance**: Efficient processing with GPU support, reducing inference time while maintaining high accuracy.
- **Modular Architecture**: Designed for easy extensibility and customization to suit a wide range of NLP tasks.

## Model Architecture

- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**: Used for sequential modeling tasks, enhanced with an attention mechanism to focus on the most relevant parts of the input text.
- **Self-Attention and Multi-Head Attention**: These components allow the model to capture contextual relationships in the input text, improving the performance of tasks such as machine translation and text generation.
- **Positional Encoding & Residual Connections**: Employed for better learning of sequential data, ensuring the model can understand word order and relationships between distant words.
- **Transformer (LLaMA/T5)**: Integrated transformer-based architecture that leverages state-of-the-art language models such as LLaMA and T5 for superior language understanding.

## Installation

### Requirements
- Python 3.7 or higher
- PyTorch 1.10.0 or higher
- CUDA-enabled GPU (optional, for faster training and inference)
- Other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

### Steps to Install

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
       git clone https://github.com/Arash-Mansourpour/VortexAI-Persian.git
       cd VortexAI-Persian

    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. (Optional) If you're using GPU, ensure you have CUDA installed for PyTorch.

4. Run the model:
    ```bash
    python run_model.py
    ```

### Datasets
- **Persian SQuAD**: A Persian version of the popular SQuAD dataset for training question answering systems.
- **Persian Q&A Dataset**: A dataset focused on Persian question-answering tasks.
- **WikiPersian**: Persian Wikipedia text for pre-training and fine-tuning models on large-scale text corpora.

## How It Works

The Vortex-Persian-NLP model employs a **transformer-based architecture** combined with **LSTM** and attention layers. Here’s how the model works:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The input text is tokenized and converted into a format suitable for training with embeddings. Augmentation techniques are applied to create diverse training samples.
2. **Model Training**: The model is trained using the combined datasets, including Persian-specific corpora, to ensure that it captures the nuances of the Persian language.
3. **Evaluation and Feedback**: Performance metrics like BLEU and ROUGE are used to evaluate the model. Based on the results, the model self-improves through regular fine-tuning.
4. **Inference**: Once trained, the model can be used for a variety of NLP tasks such as machine translation, text generation, and more.

## Evaluation Metrics

- **BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy)**: Used for machine translation tasks to measure the quality of text translation.
- **ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation)**: A metric for evaluating the quality of summaries, focusing on recall.
- **METEOR (Metric for Evaluation of Translation with Explicit ORdering)**: Another metric for evaluating machine translation, which takes into account synonyms and word order.

## Usage Examples

### Text Generation


from model import VortexModel

model = VortexModel.load_pretrained()
generated_text = model.generate_text("The future of NLP in Persian is")
print(generated_text)


question = "Who is the president of Iran?"
context = "The president of Iran is Ebrahim Raisi."
answer = model.answer_question(question, context)
print(answer)
